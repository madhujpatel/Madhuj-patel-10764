## Project Description
This project takes a number as input from the user and repeatedly calculates the sum of its digits until the result becomes a single digit. The logic is implemented using loops and basic arithmetic operations.
The project demonstrates how to break down a number into digits using modulo and division operations and how looping helps in repeating a process until a condition is satisfied.

---

## Why This Project Was Created
This project was created to:
•	Understand looping concepts
•	Practice number manipulation
•	Learn how to solve a problem step-by-step using logic
•	Strengthen fundamentals of programming
It is especially useful for beginners learning programming concepts

---

## Utility of the Project

•	Helps beginners understand program flow
•	Demonstrates user interaction in C
•	Useful as a mini-project for college or practice
•	Strengthens logic-building skills

---

## Future Scope

•	Using a random number instead of a fixed number
•	Adding difficulty levels
•	Adding a score system
•	Allowing the user to restart the game
•	Creating a GUI-based version
